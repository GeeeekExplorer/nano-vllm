## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.0 to v0.2.0

#### Breaking Changes
- None (backward compatible)

#### New Features
- Multi-GPU support via `tensor_parallel_size` parameter
- CUDA graph optimization (enabled by default)
- Prefix caching for memory efficiency

#### Performance Improvements
- 15-25% speedup in decode phase with CUDA graphs
- 20-40% memory reduction with prefix caching
- Linear scaling with multiple GPUs

#### Configuration Changes
```python
# New parameters available
llm = LLM(
    "/path/to/model",
    tensor_parallel_size=2,        # New: Multi-GPU support
    enforce_eager=False,           # New: CUDA graph control
    kvcache_block_size=256,        # New: Block size control
    gpu_memory_utilization=0.9     # New: Memory control
)
```

## Future Roadmap

### Planned for v0.3.0
- Support for additional model architectures (Llama, Mistral)
- Quantization support (INT8/INT4)
- Streaming output generation
- Continuous batching improvements

### Planned for v0.4.0
- Multi-modal model support
